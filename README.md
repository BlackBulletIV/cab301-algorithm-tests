This repository contains the code and results for assignments one and two for CAB301 at QUT. Both implement and run tests on the efficiency of algorithms.

* The first implements a binary search algorithm and tests its functionality, number of basic operations, and execution times.
* The second implements two different algorithms that find the median of a set. One is an inefficient brute force method, the other is a _quickselect_ based method. The functionality, number of basic operations, and execution times for both are tested in a comparable manner.
